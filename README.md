## CREATIVE tasks
### Worldbuilding

2. Topographical map that displays mountains and valleys (elevations)
3. Climate map that displays cold and hot regions (climate zones)
* Sketches & Lore of most important places
1. Player's home & work environment
2. The big 5 cities (animal themed)
2. a) City of Kerona (turtle)
3. Goblin Cave

### Character writing
* Truck that kills the player (might be relevant for later in the game)
* Raz, the (maybe-) god who resurrects the player into the new world (who is he? what does he want?)
* The demon king (why is he king? what makes him strong?)
* Animals, Mystical creatures, different races...
* NPCs of Kerona (who are they? what do they do?)
* NPCs of important places (king? travelling traders? goblin lord? Inhabitants of other cities? other people who got resurrected...)
1. King of the World
2. Travelling traders
3. Goblin Lord
4. NPCs from important neighbouring cities
5. Other resurrected people


### Storytelling (requires: Worldbuilding.Lore)
