## CREATIVE tasks
### Worldbuilding
* Overview
1. General map that displays all important places (cities, dungeons)
2. Topographical map that displays mountains and valleys (elevations)
3. Climate map that displays cold and hot regions (climate zones)
* Sketches of most important places
* Lore of most important places

### Character writing
* Truck that kills the player (might be relevant for later in the game)
* Raz, the (maybe-) god who resurrects the player into the new world (who is he? what does he want?)
* The demon king (why is he king? what makes him strong?)
* NPCs of Kerona (who are they? what do they do?)
* NPCs of important places (king? travelling traders? goblin lord? Inhabitants of other cities? other people who got resurrected...)
* Animals, Mystical creatures, different races...

### Storytelling (requires: Worldbuilding.Lore)
* Prolog: Player dies and gets resurrected. How does it play out?
* Act I: Player's arrival in Kerona. What happens (and why)?
