# Kerona
A First-Person Multiplayer Dungeon Crawler RPG.

# Team DevNull

# TODO
## CREATIVE tasks
### Worldbuilding
* Overview
1. General map that displays all important places (cities, dungeons)
2. Topographical map that displays mountains and valleys (elevations)
3. Climate map that displays cold and hot regions (climate zones)
* Sketches of most important places
* Lore of most important places

### Character writing (= Personas)
* Player (maybe not needed, could be left open or customized)
* Truck that kills the player (might be relevant for later in the game)
* Raz, the (maybe-) god who resurrects the player into the new world (who is he? what does he want?)
* The demon king (why is he king? what makes him strong?)
* NPCs of Kerona (who are they? what do they do?)
* NPCs of important places (king? travelling traders? goblin lord? Inhabitants of other cities? other people who got resurrected...)
* Animals, Mystical creatures, different races...

### Storytelling (requires: Worldbuilding.Lore)
* Prolog: Player dies and gets resurrected. How does it play out?
* Act I: Player's arrival in Kerona. What (and why) happens?
* Rest might be done later...

## TECHNICAL tasks
* Multiplayer functionality: Networking
 - 'guiding thread' project: https://unity.com/fps-sample?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=community_global_announcement_2018-11-27_unite-la&utm_content=sample-fps_video-unite-session-networking
 - detailed explanation of behind-the-scenes functionality of above project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1630&v=k6JTaFE7SYI
 - another example project: https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/multiplayer
* Ingame chat optimization
* Procedural dungeon generation --> plan how
* Character creation functionality --> plan how (should be done after multiplayer fundamentals)
